# ThermAP

**ThermAP** – standing for "Applied Predictive Thermodynamics" – is a predictive thermodynamic calculation program developed by Christophe Drouet at CIRIMAT-CNRS Toulouse, France. Its translation into a Python application was done by Pierre Alphonse.
ThermAP aims at estimating the standard entropy S°, formation enthalpy H_f° and Gibbs free energy G_f° of
families of complex oxides (from the elements taken in their standard state, typically at 298K/1bar).

*ThermAP* is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and use [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) as graphic user interface (GUI).
