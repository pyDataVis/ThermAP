# ThermAP

**ThermAP** – standing for "Applied Predictive Thermodynamics" – is a predictive thermodynamic calculation program developed by Christophe Drouet at CIRIMAT-CNRS Toulouse, France. Its translation into a Python application was done by Pierre Alphonse.
ThermAP aims at estimating the standard entropy, formation enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of families of complex oxides (from the elements taken in their standard state, typically at 298K/1bar).

*ThermAP* is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and use [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) as graphic user interface (GUI).
